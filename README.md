StudyRepoTemplate
=================

An OHDSI study repository is expected to have a README.md file where the header conforms to a standard. A template README file is provided here:

**[README file template](templateREADME.md)**

When initiating a repository, please copy this file, rename it to 'README.md', and fill in the fields as appropriate.

The information in the repository README file will be used to update the [list of OHDSI research studies](https://www.ohdsi.org/network-research-studies/), so it is important to fill in the template accurately, and keep it up-to-date.

## Elements in the README template

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Study title]      | A meaningful title of the research project.            
| Study status badge | A badge indicating the stuy status. See [below](#study-status) for valid options. |
| Analytics use case | One or more analytics use cases included in the study (in a comma-separated list). See [below](#analytics-use-cases) for valid options. |
| Study type | The type of study. See [below](#study-types) for valid options. |
| Tags | Zero, one, or more additional keywords that can be used to filter the list of studies. The list of tags is not restricted, but be conservative in making up new tags. For example: `EHDEN` to identify studies that are part of the [EHDEN project](https://www.ehden.eu/). |
| Study lead | The name of the study lead. Contact details are not required, since the lead is assumed to monitor the repo issue tracker and can therefore be reached that way. |
| Study start date | When did work on the study commence? This date typically indicates when development of the protocol was initiated. |
| Study end date | When was the study completed? This typicaly indicates when the analyses are completed and the results have been collected. | 
| Protocol | A hyperlink to the protocol. The protocol is expected to be a document in the study repository itself. | 
| Publications | Zero, one or more hyperlinks to papers produced as part of the study (comma-separated). | 
| Results explorer | A hyperlink to a web app (e.g. a Shiny app) where the results of the study can be explored. |
